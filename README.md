# WaveTunnel

WaveTunnel is a visual project that came to be in the mind of a programmer that also likes design and visual arts.
Getting to know processing, the project first came to be in the original [processing](https://processing.org/) software and, after awhile, got translated into the [p5 library](https://p5js.org/), in order to be easily shared and used.

The original ideia of the project was to represent a tunnel of light, where the user can control the ride almost as a game, latter some game aspects came to mind but at the moment these aspects are not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

Visit [WaveTunnel](https://fernandoesparrinha.github.io/WaveTunnel/) to check it out, you can interact with the gui, with a midi controller or you can use the keyboard controls. 

## Keyboard Controls 

Your arrow keys control some basic WaveTunnel controls, by using up and down you control the creation of new shapes (the shape can be selected on the GUI).
Your left and right arrow control the speed of the wave, speed can go from -1 to 1, meaning they can go forwards and backwards. If you handle the speed around -0.1 and 0.1 you can create some cool effects !

⚠️ Pro-tip
> If you are having too much shapes on your screen and want to reset
> you can press 0 in order to remove every shape from the screen.

⬆️ - Adds shape

⬇️ - Removes shape

0 - Removes every shape

reduces speed ⬅️  ➡️ increases speed
