# WaveTunnel

WaveTunnel is a visual project that came to be in the mind of a programmer that also likes design and visual arts.
Getting to know processing, the project first came to be in the original [processing](https://processing.org/) software and after awhile, with some inspiration of close friends (such as @g-souka), got translated into the [p5 library](https://p5js.org/), in order to be easily shared and used.

The original ideia of the project was to represent a tunnel of light, where the user can control the ride almost as a game, latter some game aspects came to mind but at the moment these aspects are not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

WaveTunnel is very easy to use. Just go into [WaveTunnel](https://fernandopinto.github.io/WaveTunnel/) to check it out and use the controls described below. 

> **⚠️ Note**
> If you are checking WaveTunnel on a mobile platform, it won't have interactable inputs. > The app will create random patterns showing what it can do, consider it a demo version.

### Controls

Controls are mainly focused on keyboard input. Altough mouse input is already in mid development.

#### In order to change the wave shapes the arrow keys can be used

⬆️ adds rectangles

⬇️ removes rectangles


reduces speed ⬅️  ➡️ increases speed

#### Colour mode can also be exchanged using the numerical keys

**1** - Fixed color mode

**2** - White mode

**3** - Random color mode

**4** - Black & White mode


## Roadmap

As a visual side project, consider this roadmap as a list of ideias that I possibly want to implement into WaveTunnel. So don't wait for the implementation of every feature described here.

- [x] Keyboard input
- [x] Colour mode
- [x] Demo version for mobile
- [x] Mobile web app 
- [ ] Different shapes (at the moment only the rectangle is available) 
- [x] Rotation of the shapes
- [ ] Audio oscilators in order to create music with the experience
- [x] GUI with inputs in order to not be restricted to the keyboard
- [ ] Mouse cursor experience
- [ ] Better mouse input
- [ ] Changelog to replace this Roadmap
